## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Framework of choice

This one was build from scratch, all html and css! The media queries are where the magic happened, trying to get the layouts to change based on screensize was pretty fun.


## Lessons Learned:

I learned that it is best not to use pixel size because it can cause issues with device compatibilty as it applies almost  like a fixed size.
